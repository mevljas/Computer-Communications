UDP), reliable data transfer, congestion control and
implementations in TCP.
6. **Network Layer**: services, virtual circuits, datagram
networks, routers, addressing, comparison of IPv4
and IPv6, routing algorithms - classification and
operation.

networks and technologies, services, error
detection and correction, multiple access protocols,
physical addressing (MAC), relation to IP addresses,
ARP protocol, switches and switching. Ethernet,
wireless protocols (IEEE 802.11x, 802.15, Blue
Tooth, 802.16...). Cellular networks, mobility. Signal
transmission, transmission media, modulation.
8. **Network security fundamentals**. Network reliability
and protection. Firewall, IDS, IPS. Symmetric and
asymmetric cryptography. PKI, digital certificate,
authentication protocols.
